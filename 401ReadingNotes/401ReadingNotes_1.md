### Good resources for beginning learning Python:

[Beginners Guide to Big O](https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation)
> This website demonstrate what Big O is. It is very straight forward and easy to understand what that is. Big O is very important for whiteboard interview.

O(1): Execute in the same time

O(n): Performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the data. 

O(N^2): Performance proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. 

O(2^N): Growth doubles with each addition to the data set. e.g. Fibonacci numbers.

O(log N): Iterate halving of data like binary search tree.
